## Hey there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35px">

I'm **Mohnish**, a Computer Science student at **Mississippi State University** (Hail State!) with a passion for writing clean, efficient code and exploring the wild world of algorithms. When I'm not pulling my hair out over debugging sessions (because let's be real, there’s always one more bug), I’m probably reading up on cutting-edge tech or bingeing sci-fi shows.

### A Little Bit About Me

- 🧠 **CS Enthusiast**: Love solving problems, from data structures to mind-boggling machine learning projects.
- ⚙️ **Languages & Tools**: Python, Java, C, C++, and the occasional Jupyter Notebook when I’m feeling fancy.
- 📚 **Learning**: Deepening my understanding of ML, AI, and systems design. 
- 📍 **Location**: Mississippi State University, Mississippi, United States.
- 💼 **Goal**: Eager to collaborate on open-source projects and any chance to learn something new.

### Featured Projects

- **[restaurant_profit](https://github.com/mohnish-dev/restaurant_profit)**  
  Predicting and analyzing restaurant profitability. Because who doesn't love both data science *and* tasty food?

- **[handwritten_digits](https://github.com/mohnish-dev/handwritten_digits)**  
  A digit-recognition model showcasing the magic of machine learning. Next step: building an AI that recognizes my questionable handwriting.

- **[percolation](https://github.com/mohnish-dev/percolation)**  
  Simplest form of machine learning meets my obsession with neural networks. A quick, fun experiment to get started in ML.

- **[work_hour_tracker](https://github.com/mohnish-dev/work_hour_tracker)**  
  Because time is money, especially when you’re a busy student juggling a million things at once.

- **[martingale_strategy](https://github.com/mohnish-dev/martingale_strategy)**  
  It's as intriguing as it sounds—some good ol’ algorithmic fun. (Now only if it could optimize real-life decision-making, right?)

- **[caesar_cipher](https://github.com/mohnish-dev/caesar_cipher)**  
  Old-school encryption for the modern age. Who said classic ciphers can’t be cool?
